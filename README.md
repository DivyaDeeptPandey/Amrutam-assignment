🌿 Amrutam Assignment – Consumer Portal

Hi! I'm Divya, and this is my submission for the Full-stack Developer assignment at Amrutam. I chose to build the Consumer Portal because I love crafting intuitive user experiences and solving real-world problems through clean, scalable code.

This project reflects my passion for both frontend polish and backend architecture — from animated product cards to secure authentication and order flows.

💬 Why This Project Matters to Me

I approached this assignment not just as a checklist, but as a chance to build something I’d be proud to use. I focused on clarity, responsiveness, and user flow — and made sure the backend logic was just as thoughtful.

Every bug I fixed and every animation I added was a little celebration. I hope that comes through when you explore the app.

🙏 Thank You

Thank you for the opportunity to work on something meaningful. I’m excited about the possibility of joining a team that values wellness, creativity, and thoughtful technology.

Warmly,  
Divya
